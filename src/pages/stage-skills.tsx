Ever seen a show where you see the back of a performer&apos;s head for most of the show, or just can&apos;t hear them? Ever see a scene end and chairs strewn about, leaving the next scene players to deal with it? This workshop is designed to help your stage presence by turning theater best practices into good habits.

<p>
  <ul>
<li>- Resetting the stage</li>
<li>- Projecting your voice</li>
<li>- Being seen and upstaging</li>
<li>- Comfortably embracing silences</li>
<li>- Simplifying and improving your space-object work</li>
<li>- and more...</li>
</ul>
